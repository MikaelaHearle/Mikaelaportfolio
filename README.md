# Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio.
I work as a frontend developer, and this project represents the first updated draft of my portfolio.

The portfolio is built with a focus on clean structure, component-based development, and accessibility. It serves as a foundation that will be iterated on over time as design, content, and functionality continue to evolve.
